# Tic-Tac-toe Application

## Technologies Used:
Built on ATOM, this application utilises HTML, SCSS,
JavaScript, and an API. This project was done entirely
on a Macbook Pro.

## Planning:
Before coding the application, a plan was set in place to
set up the repository, browser template, and deploy to GH
Pages.
